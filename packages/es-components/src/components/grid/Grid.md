We use a minified, isolated, CSS version of [Bootstrap Grid](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/layout/grid/) for layout needs. No JS required!

To include it in your project, add the following stylesheet reference:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://bdaim-webexcdn-p.azureedge.net/es-assets/grid.css" />
```

Refer to the [official Bootstrap Grid documentation](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/layout/grid/) for usage.
